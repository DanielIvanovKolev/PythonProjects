# Stock Price Prediction Project

## Overview

This project aims to predict stock prices using machine learning algorithms. It's designed to help beginners understand the application of AI in financial markets, starting with simple models and progressing to more complex ones.

## Features

- Utilizes historical stock data for predictions
- Implements various machine learning models:
  - Linear Regression (for beginners)
  - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks (advanced)
- Focuses on crucial aspects of financial data analysis:
  - Data preprocessing
  - Feature selection
  - Time series analysis

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, tensorflow (for LSTM)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-price-prediction.git
   ```
2. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset in CSV format
2. Run the data preprocessing script:
   ```
   python preprocess_data.py
   ```
3. Train the model:
   ```
   python train_model.py
   ```
4. Make predictions:
   ```
   python predict.py
   ```
